The QuickDB uses CoreData with a SUPER easy use case that you can store any codable objects and query for them in just 1 line of code.
This component is highly recommended for small scale applications to store user data and settings with custom class types.

## HOW?

__Step 1:__

Confirm your codable to have a UUID with protocol `QuickIndexable`

```swift
struct MyModel: QuickIndexable {
  let uid = UUID()
  ...
}
```

__Step 2:__

Save your object to QuickDB

```swift
  QuickDB.shared.insert(model: myModel)
```

__Step 3:__

Retrieve all your objects from QuickDB

```swift
QuickDB.shared.getAll(LatestObjects: { (items: [MyModel]) in
      //use your inserted items here
	print(items)
}) { (error) in
	print(error)
}
```

QuickDB uses generic functions to query all records that matches with your Model type.self

## Note

üí¢There are usecases that optimized for storing large files like `Image`, `Audio`, etc.
